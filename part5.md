## What Is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis is the application of natural language processing and text mining techniques to quantify positive, negative, or neutral opinions expressed in textual data about companies, markets, or products.[^8]

## Benefits of Sentiment Analysis

- **Real-time Market Insights**: Captures evolving investor mood faster than traditional financial indicators, providing early warnings of market shifts.[^9]  
- **Alternative Data Source**: Leverages unstructured data (e.g., news articles, social media) to uncover information not reflected in financial statements.[^5]  
- **Enhanced Predictive Power**: When combined with quantitative models, sentiment scores can improve the accuracy of price forecasts and trading signals.[^10]  

## Limitations of Sentiment Analysis

- **Data Sparsity for Individual Stocks**: Insufficient volume of relevant text data can lead to unreliable signals for single equities.[^11]  
- **Noise and False Positives**: Information overload and varying writing styles can generate misleading or contradictory sentiment scores.[^12]  
- **Domain-Specific Challenges**: Financial language nuances require specialized lexicons (e.g., Loughran and McDonald) to avoid misclassification.[^7]  
- **Model Maintenance**: NLP models must be regularly retrained to adapt to evolving language usage and market contexts.[^13]  

## Applying Sentiment Analysis in Your Term Project

In our consumer discretionary knowledge graph project, we could:

1. **Create `NewsArticle` and `SocialMediaPost` nodes** with attributes for sentiment polarity and confidence scores derived from NLP models.[^14]  
2. **Link sentiment nodes to `Company` nodes** to track how public opinion affects specific consumer discretionary firms over time.  
3. **Aggregate sentiment time series** as features for your RAG-based recommendation engine, enabling queries like “Which companies saw sentiment improve after earnings calls?”  
4. **Combine sentiment indicators with fundamental and technical metrics** (e.g., P/E ratios, moving averages) to build hybrid signals that reflect both market mood and underlying fundamentals.[^15]
