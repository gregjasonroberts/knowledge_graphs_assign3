# Part 3: Identify and Cite Trustworthy Online Resources for Fundamental Analysis of Investments

Fundamental analysis is a technique for measuring a security’s intrinsic value by examining a company’s financial statements (e.g., revenue, assets, liabilities) alongside broader economic indicators like GDP and interest rates.[^1]

## Trustworthy Online Resources for Fundamental Analysis

- **Wikipedia – Fundamental analysis**: Objective overview of the methodology, including its focus on financial statements and macroeconomic factors.[^1]  
- **CFA Institute – Equity Valuation: Concepts and Basic Tools**: Authoritative reading on models for estimating a security’s intrinsic value, including discounted cash-flow and multiples approaches.[^2]  
- **U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission – EDGAR Full Text Search**: Official portal to retrieve primary filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K) that form the backbone of financial statement analysis.[^4]  
- **Yahoo Finance**: Widely used for quick access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow data.[^5]  

## What Is Fundamental Analysis?

Fundamental analysis is a technique for measuring a security’s intrinsic value by examining a company’s financial statements—such as revenue, assets, and liabilities—alongside broader economic indicators like GDP and interest rates.

## Benefits of Fundamental Analysis

- Focuses on underlying value drivers (e.g., earnings growth, cash flow generation, competitive advantages), enabling identification of undervalued or overvalued securities.
- Provides a long-term investment framework less influenced by short-term market noise.

## Limitations of Fundamental Analysis

- Relies on estimates and intrinsic value forecasts that can vary significantly across analysts.[^8]  
- Evaluating qualitative factors (e.g., management quality, brand strength) is complex and subjective.[^8]  

## Applying Fundamental Analysis in Your Term Project

In our term project—building a consumer discretionary knowledge graph—we could:

1. **Create Company nodes linked to Financial Metric nodes** (e.g., P/E ratio, debt-to-equity ratio) extracted from EDGAR filings.[^10]  
2. **Enable queries to identify companies trading below intrinsic value** by feeding these metrics into a RAG-based recommendation engine.  
3. **Map how changes in financial fundamentals propagate** across peer group and industry relationships, enriching your graph’s predictive insights.[^11]
