## Applying Fundamental Analysis in Your Term Project

In our term project—building a consumer discretionary knowledge graph—we could:

1. **Create Company nodes linked to Financial Metric nodes** (e.g., P/E ratio, debt-to-equity ratio) extracted from EDGAR filings :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
2. **Enable queries to identify companies trading below intrinsic value** by feeding these metrics into a RAG-based recommendation engine  
3. **Map how changes in financial fundamentals propagate** across peer group and industry relationships, enriching your graph’s predictive insights :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
