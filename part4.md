# Part 4: Identify and Cite Trustworthy Online Resources for Technical Analysis of Investments

## Trustworthy Online Resources for Technical Analysis

- **Wikipedia – Technical analysis**: Historical context, theory, and empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of technical analysis.[^1]    
- **TradingView – Technical Analysis Scripts and Indicators**: Library of community-built indicators and tools for automated technical analysis.[^2]  

## What Is Technical Analysis?

Technical analysis is the study of past market data—primarily price and trading volume—to forecast future price movements.[^3]

## Benefits of Technical Analysis

- Helps identify short-term trading opportunities by signaling potential entry and exit points.[^4]  
- Applies across various asset classes and timeframes, offering flexibility to different trading styles.[^5]  
- Provides objective, rule-based indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD) to reduce emotional decision-making.[^2]  

## Limitations of Technical Analysis

- Based solely on historical data, which may not accurately predict future events, especially during unforeseen market shifts.[^5]  
- Prone to false signals and “whipsaws” in sideways or choppy markets.[^4]  
- Interpretations can vary between analysts; reliable use often requires backtesting and skill.  
- Critics argue it may be a self-fulfilling prophecy and is challenged by the Efficient Market Hypothesis.[^5]  

## Applying Technical Analysis in Your Term Project

In our consumer discretionary knowledge graph project, we could:

1. **Model Time-Series Price Data as Nodes**: Create `Price` nodes timestamped with close, high, low, and volume, linked to `Company` nodes.  
2. **Compute Indicator Nodes**: Generate nodes for indicators—like `MovingAverage`, `RSI`, and `MACD`—and link them to both `Company` and `Price` nodes.  
3. **Enable Pattern and Signal Queries**: Query the graph for specific patterns (e.g., moving average crossovers) to flag potential trade signals and visualize momentum across peer groups. 
4. **Integrate with RAG Recommendations**: Feed these technical signals into your RAG-based engine as features to enhance short-term trading insights and complement your fundamental analysis.
