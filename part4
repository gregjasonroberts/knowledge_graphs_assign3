## Applying Technical Analysis in Your Term Project

In the consumer discretionary knowledge graph project, you could:

1. **Model Time-Series Price Data as Nodes**: Create `Price` nodes timestamped with close, high, low, and volume, linked to `Company` nodes.  
2. **Compute Indicator Nodes**: Generate nodes for indicators—like `MovingAverage`, `RSI`, and `MACD`—and link them to both `Company` and `Price` nodes :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}.  
3. **Enable Pattern and Signal Queries**: Query the graph for specific patterns (e.g., moving average crossovers) to flag potential trade signals and visualize momentum across peer groups :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.  
4. **Integrate with RAG Recommendations**: Feed these technical signals into your RAG-based engine as features to enhance short-term trading insights and complement your fundamental analysis.

This structure enriches the knowledge graph with dynamic market behavior, enabling nuanced insights into price trends and technical patterns.
