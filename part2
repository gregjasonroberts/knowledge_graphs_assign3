# Part 2: Chapter 8 and Chapter 9

## Summary
Chapters 8 and 9 delve into two foundational challenges in knowledge graph construction. Chapter 8 covers **instance matching**, the task of identifying when different graph nodes refer to the same real-world entity. It explains why brute-force comparisons are infeasible at scale and surveys blocking techniques—such as sorted neighborhood and canopies—that reduce candidate pairs before applying probabilistic (Fellegi–Sunter) or machine-learning scorers. Chapter 9 introduces **statistical relational learning (SRL)**, which overcomes the i.i.d. assumption of traditional ML by encoding relational dependencies with weighted logical formulas. Two prominent SRL frameworks—**Markov Logic Networks (MLNs)** and **Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)**—are described, along with their inference and learning strategies, and their use in cleaning and enriching noisy KG extractions.

## Key Points

1. **Instance Matching & Its Importance**  
   Consolidates disparate information about the same entity but faces challenges from syntactic variations, missing context, and domain-specific ambiguity.

2. **Scalable Blocking Schemes**  
   Techniques like block purging, sorted neighborhood, and canopies reduce O(n²) comparisons to near-linear complexity in practice.

3. **Two-Stage Scoring Pipelines**  
   After blocking, candidate pairs are scored via probabilistic (Fellegi–Sunter) or supervised ML classifiers, enabling controlled precision–recall trade-offs.

4. **SRL Frameworks for Relational Data**  
   MLNs and PSL integrate first-order logic with probability to model relational dependencies and support joint inference over noisy, incomplete graphs.
